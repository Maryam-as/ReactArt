# ReactArt Demo App

This is a demo project created as part of the **React - The Complete Guide 2025 (including Next.js & Redux)** course on Udemy, taught by **Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller**.

## Project Overview

In this project, I explore various approaches to styling React components and applications. The key styling techniques covered include:

- **Vanilla CSS**: Basic styling with traditional CSS
- **CSS Modules**: Scoping styles to components
- **Styled Components**: CSS-in-JS for component-based styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Static and Dynamic Styling**: Both static and conditional styling approaches

## What I Learned

Throughout the project, I learned several key concepts and techniques for styling React apps:

- **Splitting CSS across multiple files** for better maintainability
- **Conditional inline styling** for dynamic styling based on conditions
- **Creating CSS string classes using template literals**
- **Dynamically setting class names** with ternary expressions
- **Scoped CSS with CSS Modules** to prevent class name collisions
- **Creating styled components** with **Styled Components** and tagged templates
- **Dynamic & conditional styling** with **Styled Components**
- **Applying nested CSS rules**, media queries, and pseudo-selectors using **Styled Components**
- **Building reusable components** and combining them effectively
- **Using Tailwind CSS utility classes** to style components quickly and efficiently
- **Customizing the Tailwind CSS theme** by adding custom fonts in the `tailwind.config.js` file
- **Responsive design** using Tailwind CSS media query utilities
- **Applying pseudo-selectors** using Tailwind CSS utilities
- **Conditionally applying Tailwind utility classes** based on state or conditions
